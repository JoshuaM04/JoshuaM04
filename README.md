## Hi there 👋

I'm Joshua, a front-end web developer based in the United States. <br/>
I have experience with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. <br />
I'm constantly expanding my knowledge about front-end web development thanks to one of my favorite authors on the subject, Jon Duckett. <br />
I have completed various small projects which were inspired from designs on FrontEnd Mentor! <br />

Fun Facts:
* I'm a huge fan of spicy foods
* I love chicken wings 
* I'm an avid horror movie enjoyer
* Marvel Rivals is my favorite game
